        <h3>Step 1: Reducing Single-Use Plastics</h3>
        <p>
          Single-use plastics are one of the most harmful contributors to waste.
          Start by switching to reusable bags, bottles, and containers. Avoid
          products with excessive plastic packaging, and choose alternatives
          like glass or metal.

        <h3>Step 2: Energy Efficiency at Home</h3>
        <p>
          Switch to energy-efficient appliances like LED bulbs and smart
          thermostats. Insulate your home properly, and unplug devices when not
          in use to reduce electricity consumption and save money on your energy
          bills.

          Public transportation, biking, and electric cars are great
          alternatives to conventional cars. Consider carpooling or using shared
          rides to further cut down on emissions and save on fuel costs.
